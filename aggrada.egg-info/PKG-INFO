Automatic spatiotemporal aggregation of multi-source heterogeneous raw data at multiple granularities.

## Overview

Aggrada is a Python library designed to automate the process of aggregating heterogeneous raw data from multiple sources across different spatial and temporal granularities. It helps researchers and data scientists identify optimal granularity levels that maximize data consistency and representativeness.

The framework is particularly useful for working with open data sources that have varying formats, spatial scales, and temporal resolutions.

## Features

- Read and process data from various formats (CSV, Excel, Shapefile, JSON)
- Automatically index data spatially and temporally
- Aggregate data at different spatial and temporal granularities
- Evaluate data consistency across different granularity levels
- Visualize aggregated data and analysis results

## Installation

```bash
pip install aggrada
```

## Quick Start

```python
import aggrada as ag

# Read data from a CSV file
data = ag.read_csv("data.csv")

# Index data spatially and temporally
indexed_data = ag.index(data, 
                        spatial_column="location", 
                        temporal_column="date")

# Aggregate data at different granularities
aggregated_data = ag.aggregate(indexed_data, 
                               spatial_granularity="municipality", 
                               temporal_granularity="monthly")

# Evaluate consistency across granularities
consistency = ag.evaluate_consistency(aggregated_data)

# Visualize results
ag.plot(aggregated_data)
```
