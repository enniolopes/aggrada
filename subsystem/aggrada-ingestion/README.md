### Future Research:

**Language Models for indexes fields identification:**

- To the identication of the fields from raw data that contains spatial and time references we need to use some kind of semantic search. Initally we are addressing this to user input.
  This job is not efficient using an extensive discrete logic of each possible case of spatial and time fields and values due to hetegoneity of the data. Therefore, the automatization seems to be better handled with AI Language Models.
